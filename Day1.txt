To check weather the network folder is conected or not
we can ping in commond prompt using the ip address of the network

win+r
cmd
//sourcedrive/ping ipaddress

DAY-1 AGENDA

JAVA --> JEE --> FRAMEWORK --> SPRING --> SPRING BOOT

DATABASE
	Open Database --> My SQL (Free/opensource)

SUN TECHNOLOGIES (James Gosling)--> Oracle
	1. JSE --> Java Standard Edition (Core Java)
	2. JEE --> Java Enterprise Edition ( Advance Java)
	3. J2ME --> Java Micro Edition (Mobile) 
	4. JFX 

JDK 17 is the latest version released on Sep 14 2021
	--> JDK stands for Java Devolopment Kit

For training purpose we are using JDK 1.8 which is free ware version

Installing JDK
	JDK
	JRE (Java Run time Environment)
To run java in the computer we need the java runtime environment

-->HLL High level language (Human)
	Translator
		1. Compiler
			Execute the entire code and translate
		2. Interpretor
			Line by line translate
-->LLL Low level language

JSE 
	Translator (Interpreter(command java) + Compiler (command javac))

To check the version of JSE installed in the system
Step1 : win+r
	cmd
Step2 : java -version
	javac -version

	If JDK is not installed, install the JDK (C:\Program Files\Java --> default location)
Step3: Configure in environment variable
	Edit system variables
	Advanced
	Environment Variables
	Path --> Edit
	1) path = location of jdk\bin (ex: C:\Program Files\Java\bin) Need to move up to give the priority to java. 
								      This will be acheived my pressing Home key on 
								      keyboard and need to paste the path. 
	2)JAVA_HOME = location of jdk 
	New --> Variable name: JAVA_HOME
		Path: C:\Program Files\Java
Step4: Software
	1> To work with the java we need a text editor (Notepad)
	2> CLI (Command Line Interface)

	--> Once the code is written, need to save it with the name which is same name of the class that written in the code 
	with the extension .java in the desired folder.
	--> Then type cmd in the desired folder path bar which will redirect to the command prompt with the desired path
	As we know first we need to compile the java file
	In command prompt type javac <filename with the extension> then press enter
	Java compiler compiles the java file and creates the Java class file which we call it as a java byte code which
	will be furter interpreted by java interpreter
	Type java <filename without extension>
	Then the desired output can be seen in the command Prompt 
	























Hello world Program

public class HelloWorld{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		System.out.println("Hello World")
	}
}

// public is a access modifier. Which will give the access to the class. Public, Private, Protected are the access modifiers
// class is a keyword to define the class HelloWorld
// HelloWorld is the class name. The same name should be given to the file with the extension of .java
// main() is the method from which the the methods of the class will be called. Its like a door to enter into the class
// System.out.println command will print the "Hello World" string in the console
